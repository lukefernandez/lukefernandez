### Luke Fernandez = Strategy + Architecture + Full-Stack Engineering

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Luke, and I am currently bootstrapping a collective of social good projects.

I strive to build products that make the world a better place for humanity, the planet, and our animal friends. Day to day, I walk the line between strategy, architecture, and full-stack engineering.

Among other things, I have been fortunate enough to:

- Build enterprise-grade apps and platforms for some of the biggest brands in the world
- Lead a hardware-software product from ideation to launch to the sound of a nine-figure deal
- Design and deliver cutting-edge solutions across healthcare, software, manufacturing, and more

My core competencies include:

- Product Lifecycle Management
- Software and Cloud Architecture
- Full-Stack Software Engineering
- Business and Organizational Strategy
- Leading and Empowering Engineering Teams
